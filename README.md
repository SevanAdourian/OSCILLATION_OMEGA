# OSCILLATION_OMEGA

Codes to compute the rotational oscillation period generated by gravitational interactions between mass anomalies in the core and the mantle of the Earth.
All codes in Fortran, with cmake as a cross-compiling tool. Work in progress. Currently serial code.

1. Download and compilation:
git clone https://github.com/SevanAdourian/OSCILLATION_OMEGA.git
cd OSCILLATION_OMEGA
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort ../ # if intel compiler
cmake -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran ../ # if gnu compiler
make

2. Running the code
./oscillation_omega
